Survive the Gauntlet 

Survive the Gauntlet is a maze game created for my class project @ GA. This is the game in its basic version. It's still under works 
at the moment, but by the end it will transform from a simple maze game to a dungeon crawl. 

My application currently renders a random maze that allows two tiles to wander around it through while also staying within the rendered cells. 
The goal of my game is to successfully navigate both tiles through the maze to the yellow tile (representing daylight). The tiles move 
independantly which allows the game to be played with two players as intended. 


How to Play: 
1. Player 1: use the WASD keys to traverse the maze 
2. Player 2: use the Arrow keys to traverse the maze

Win condition: 
1. a win is achieved by both players successfully navigating out of the maze to daylight

Loss condition: 
1. There is poisonous gases in the maze that will kill each player in 45 seconds. If both players don't escape before the timer runs out then the screen will alert "Game Over" and you can reload to play again. 



Issues: 
1. initially I used canvas to build a maze from a tileset which is a png used as a template for building. I couldn't get the pixels to size correctly so I went to my backup plan of building the maze without a tileset. This was the hardest part of the project for me, and I should have dropped it sooner for a more simple solution so that I could finish the project properly. 

2. Lose condition was met, but game wouldnt reload properly

3. struggled to access end location to achieve win condition: 


Things I learned: 
1. Canvas can be pretty cool, but you need to know what you are doing

2. canvas can be layered
